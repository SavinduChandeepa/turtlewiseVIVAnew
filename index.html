            <p>Sri Lanka is known for its beautiful beaches and crystal-clear waters, home to a diverse population of sea turtles. The island is located in the Indian Ocean, along the path of the turtle migration, making it an important nesting and breeding site for these ancient creatures. Unfortunately, the turtle populations in Sri Lanka are under severe threat, with their numbers declining rapidly due to various human activities and climate change. In this essay, we will explore the different types of sea turtles found in Sri Lanka, their habitats, the threats they face, and the conservation efforts being taken to protect and conserve them.</p>

            <p>Sri Lanka is home to five species of sea turtles, making it a vital location for sea turtle conservation efforts. Each of these species plays a unique role in the marine ecosystem, from the Green Turtle's herbivorous diet to the Hawksbill Turtle's role in maintaining coral reef health.</p>

                    <p>The green turtle, scientifically known as Chelonia mydas, is a fascinating marine reptile that belongs to the family Cheloniidae. As their name suggests, they have a characteristic green coloration, particularly on their fat deposits and skin, although their shells are typically brown or olive in color. Green turtles are known for their large size, with adults reaching an average length of 3 to 4 feet (1 to 1.2 meters) and weighing around 200 to 500 pounds (90 to 230 kilograms).</p>

                    <p>The hawksbill turtle is a critically endangered species of sea turtle found in tropical and subtropical waters around the world, including Sri Lanka. They are named for their sharply pointed beak, which they use to feed on sponges and other invertebrates. Hawksbill turtles are smaller than other sea turtle species, with adults typically weighing between 100 and 200 pounds, and are unfortunately heavily hunted for their ornate carapace.</p>

It is named for its large head and strong jaw, which it uses to feed on hard-shelled prey such as crabs and mollusks. Loggerhead turtles are one of the largest sea turtle species, with adults weighing between 200 and 400 pounds, and like other sea turtles, they face a variety of threats including habitat loss, pollution, and accidental capture in fishing nets.</p>

                <p>Sea turtles are facing a number of threats that are putting their survival in jeopardy. These threats range from habitat loss and pollution to overfishing and climate change. Sea turtles are also at risk of entanglement in fishing nets and other debris in the ocean, which can lead to injury or death. In addition, illegal poaching and egg collection continue to be major threats to sea turtle populations in many parts of the world. It is essential that we take action to address these threats and work towards the conservation and protection of these beloved marine creatures.

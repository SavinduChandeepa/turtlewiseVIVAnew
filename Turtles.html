            <p>Sri Lanka is blessed with a rich diversity of sea turtles, making it a vital sanctuary for these magnificent creatures. Five species of sea turtles can be found in the waters surrounding the island: the Green Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, and Olive Ridley Turtle. Each species has its own unique characteristics and ecological significance. The Green Turtle, with its herbivorous diet and distinctive heart-shaped shell, is a frequent visitor to Sri Lanka's nesting beaches. The Hawksbill Turtle, known for its beautiful patterned shell, plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of coral reefs through its feeding habits. <br><br>The Loggerhead Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, and Olive Ridley Turtle also grace Sri Lankan waters, each contributing to the intricate balance of the marine ecosystem. Despite the challenges they face, including habitat loss and human activity, Sri Lanka remains committed to conserving and protecting these incredible sea turtles. Through ongoing efforts in research, education, and conservation initiatives, the turtles of Sri Lanka have a fighting chance to thrive and continue enchanting us with their beauty and resilience.</p>

            <p>The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is a species of sea turtle found in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide, including Sri Lanka. It is named for the green color of its body fat caused by its herbivorous diet. Green turtles have a large size, reaching weights between 200 and 500 pounds and lengths of up to 3-4 feet.

                These turtles have a heart-shaped carapace (upper shell) that is flexible and leathery, with bony plates. Their strong flippers enable them to swim long distances and dive to great depths in search of food. Green turtles are known for their long migrations between feeding grounds and nesting beaches.<br><br>
                
                Nesting season for green turtles in Sri Lanka typically occurs from September to March. Females come ashore to lay their eggs, with thousands of eggs being laid in a single nesting event. Unfortunately, green turtles face threats including habitat loss, pollution, and climate change. Destruction of nesting beaches, pollution from plastic debris and oil spills, and changes in ocean currents and temperatures all impact their survival.
                
                Conservation efforts in Sri Lanka focus on monitoring nesting sites, protecting eggs from predators, and raising awareness among local communities. By preserving their habitats and implementing sustainable practices, we can ensure the continued survival of the remarkable green turtles for future generations.</p>

        <div class="container">
            
            <p>The loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) is a species of sea turtle known for its large head and powerful jaws. It is named for its distinctively large size and robust head, which houses strong jaws capable of crushing and consuming its prey.

                Loggerhead turtles are found in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. They undertake extensive migrations, traveling long distances between feeding grounds and nesting beaches. These turtles exhibit remarkable navigational abilities, often returning to the same beach where they hatched to lay their own eggs.<br><br>
                
                Their diet consists mainly of bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as crabs, mollusks, and jellyfish. Their strong jaws and sharp beak allow them to efficiently crush the hard shells of their prey. However, they are known to have a somewhat opportunistic diet, occasionally consuming other food sources such as seaweed, sargassum, and fish.
                
                Loggerhead turtles face numerous threats, including habitat loss, pollution, bycatch in fishing gear, and climate change. They are listed as a vulnerable species due to these factors. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their nesting beaches, reducing marine pollution, implementing sustainable fishing practices, and raising awareness about the importance of preserving their habitats.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="title-box"><h2>Known Locations</h2></div>
        <p style="background-color:#EA2027 ; width: 95%; color: aliceblue;">While loggerhead turtles may occasionally visit Sri Lankan waters during their oceanic migrations, they do not have established nesting populations on the island's beaches. It is important to note that sea turtle populations and nesting sites can vary, and occasional sightings or interactions with loggerhead turtles in Sri Lankan waters are possible but relatively rare.</p>

        <div class="container">
            
            <p>The leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) is a unique and fascinating species of sea turtle. It is the largest turtle species in the world, with adults reaching lengths of up to 7 feet (2.1 meters) and weighing around 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms). Unlike other sea turtles, the leatherback turtle lacks a hard, bony shell and instead has a leathery carapace, hence its name.

                One of the most remarkable features of the leatherback turtle is its diet. It primarily feeds on jellyfish, using its specialized jaws and throat structure to consume these slippery prey. This diet is highly energy-efficient, allowing the leatherback turtle to travel vast distances in search of food.<br><br>
                
                Leatherback turtles are known for their extensive migratory behavior. They undertake epic journeys, traveling thousands of miles between foraging areas and nesting beaches. They can cross entire ocean basins, migrating from feeding grounds in cooler regions to nesting beaches in tropical and subtropical areas.
                
                Nesting plays a crucial role in the life cycle of leatherback turtles. Females return to the same nesting beaches where they were born to lay their own eggs. Leatherback turtle hatchlings emerge from their nests and make their way to the ocean, facing numerous challenges and predation risks along the way.</p>

            <p>The olive ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) is a small to medium-sized sea turtle found in tropical and subtropical waters, including Sri Lanka. They get their name from the olive color of their shell and skin. Olive ridley turtles are known for their unique nesting behavior, which often involves mass nesting events known as arribadas, where thousands of females come ashore simultaneously to lay their eggs.

                These turtles have a slightly heart-shaped carapace (upper shell) and a hooked beak. They are primarily omnivorous, feeding on a variety of marine invertebrates, crustaceans, jellyfish, and algae. Their diet may vary depending on the availability of food in their habitat.<br><br>
                
                Nesting season for olive ridley turtles in Sri Lanka typically occurs from December to March. Females emerge at night and dig nests in the sand, laying around 100-150 eggs per clutch. After an incubation period of about 45-60 days, the hatchlings emerge and make their way to the ocean.
                 Overall, the olive ridley turtle is a remarkable species that contributes to the biodiversity and health of marine ecosystems. Efforts to protect and conserve these turtles are crucial to ensure their survival for future generations.</p>

            <h2>What is habitat loss?</h2>
            <img src="new images/habitat loss.jpg" id="HL-img">
            <div class="container">
           
                
                <p>Habitat loss poses a significant threat to sea turtles, jeopardizing their survival and reproductive success. Coastal development, pollution, and erosion of nesting beaches due to human activities are primary drivers of habitat loss. As urbanization and infrastructure encroach upon natural coastal areas, sea turtles face the loss of crucial nesting sites. Moreover, pollution, including marine debris and chemical contaminants, can degrade their foraging grounds and disrupt their feeding patterns. These disturbances not only impact the adult turtles but also have cascading effects on their offspring, as hatchlings rely on undisturbed beaches to safely emerge and make their way to the sea. Efforts to conserve and protect sea turtle habitats, including coastal conservation measures and responsible development practices, are essential to ensure the long-term survival of these magnificent creatures.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Consequences</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <h3>Reduced Nesting Sites</h3>
                <p>Habitat loss leads to the depletion of suitable nesting sites for sea turtles.

                <p>Turtles can become entangled in fishing gear such as nets, lines, and traps, resulting in severe injuries or drowning. The weight and structure of fishing gear can cause physical harm, leading to fractures, amputations, and internal injuries. Many turtles do not survive these encounters, resulting in direct mortality.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <h3>Population Decline</h3>
                <p> Bycatch can significantly impact turtle populations, especially when they involve species already facing conservation challenges. The indiscriminate nature of fishing gear can capture turtles of various species and age classes, including juveniles and adults that are crucial for population growth. The removal of a large number of individuals from the population can disrupt breeding patterns and reduce reproductive success, leading to population declines.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <h3>Disruption of Life Cycle</h3>
                <p>Fishing and bycatch can disrupt the natural life cycle of turtles.
